# Supervised-Learning-Algorithms

Developer: Sathish Sampath(ss.sathishsampath@gmail.com)

## Description:
Develop and compare the performance of 5 Supervised Learning algorithms
 * Decision Tree
 * Artificial Neural Networks
 * Support Vector Machines
 * K-Nearest Neighbor
 * Boosting

## Dataset Used: 
 Adult Dataset and Biodegradation dataset from UCI Data repository(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html)





## Installation

1. Install Conda, a CLI tool

   https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html

2. Use Conda to install all dependencies through `environment.yml` by navigating to the "code and datasets" folder.

```
    conda env create -f environment.yml
```

3. Activate the environment created by conda

```
    source activate mlp3
```
4. Open Spyder IDE through conda
```
    spyder
```

5. You're set, read the next sections in order to be able to run any of the experiments.  

## Running Script
